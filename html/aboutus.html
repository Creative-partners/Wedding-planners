          <!-- <p class="title">CEO & Founder</p> -->
          <p>I am Alaa Al-Hayek, I was a sales representative in one of the major retail stores in Irbid
            I decided to enter programming developing websites because technology is an important part of life, and it
            makes solving problems in society easier ... so I had to learn it to be one of the keys to solutions for my
            country, Syria in the future, and for my current community in Jordan..it is the best decision I made in my
            life
            Because although I am very active and have a lot of skills, this skill will be a nice and powerful transfer
            in my life path and I will definitely use it in a perfect way and teach it to all interested.
            I am fortunate at this point because all my experiences and expertise will be in my interest in the future
            when I start independence..I say yes and I am sure that I will be important in this field because of my past
            experience as well as the current touch and experience of technology</p>

          <!-- <p class="title">Art Director</p> -->
          <p>My name is Sally Ammous, and I'm currently perusing a Software Development certification from Code Fellows
            at Luminus Technical University College. Prior to this, I was an operations manager at an American apparels
            company. My role there aside from managerial tasks, also included handling the largest account of the
            company, data analysis and customer care. My time at my last job, opened my eyes to how vital a cohesive and
            up-to-date online business presence is since, our business-to-customer channels were exclusively online and,
            about 90% of our business-to-business operations were online as well. Having been, in such a tech reliant
            company, I experienced first hand what customers look for in an online business, this combined with my
            pre-existing marketing and business knowledge, will give me ad edge as a software developer.</p>

          <p>I am farah alzayyout , i spent my last four years studying a civil engineering in the hashemite university
            , although i have a very good GPA in my specialisation, i couldn't feel that i am okay with completing my
            rest of life in it. i tried to search for another field until i had a cross line with programming, and here
            i am .. actually i am excited to get involved through this environment. and i believe that my previous
            experiences in engineering will help me too .. spending long time with solving problems for sure will
            affecting my progress in learning some coding matters</p>
